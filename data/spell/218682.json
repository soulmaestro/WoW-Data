    "description": "In his former life, before making the ritualistic changes to become one of the Illidari, Jace was a powerful mage. He still retains much of his magic knowledge. Combined with his mastery over the fel energies coursing through his body, he has created many useful devices for the Illidari, such as the nether crucibles, demon traps, and wards.",
