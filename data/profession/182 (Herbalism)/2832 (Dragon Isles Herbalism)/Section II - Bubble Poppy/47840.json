    "description": "Bubble Poppy is a delicate herb that grows in the aquatic locales of the Dragon Isles. It grows along the rivers, coasts, and inside damp caves. \r\n\r\nDespite its unique appearance, the Bubble Poppy flower isn't particularly useful. Rather, the watery, fungal orb that forms at its base is where the real value lies.  \r\n\r\nFound growing only in places of embroiled conflict, rumor has it that these herbs have gained magical properties from the ire of those fighting around them. \r\n\r\nGain the following effect when gathering: \r\n\r\n Fury of Battle:\r\nYou have a chance when slaying enemy players to gain Rousing Ire. Lasts 2 min.\r\n\r\nFurther mining or herb gathering extends the duration.",
