    "description": "Bubble Poppy is a delicate herb that grows in the aquatic locales of the Dragon Isles. It grows along the rivers, coasts, and inside damp caves. \r\n\r\nDespite its unique appearance, the Bubble Poppy flower isn't particularly useful. Rather, the watery, fungal orb that forms at its base is where the real value lies.\r\n\r\nWhen exposed to colder climates or are located near sources of water, they can become infused with elemental frost. Gathering these types of herbs will cover the ground in slick ice, but the herbalist will be rewarded with Rousing Frost for their efforts.\r\n\r\nHerbalists specialized in Frigid herbs will gain the following effect when gathering:\r\n\r\n Frigid Petals:\r\nEnvelops you in a cloud of frost which causes any enemy who approaches too close to you to become frozen momentarily.",
