    "description": "Bubble Poppy is a delicate herb that grows in the aquatic locales of the Dragon Isles. It grows along the rivers, coasts, and inside damp caves. \r\n\r\nDespite its unique appearance, the Bubble Poppy flower isn't particularly useful. Rather, the watery, fungal orb that forms at its base is where the real value lies.\r\n\r\nHerbs that grow in areas rich in the influence of the Titans, such as the Waking Shores or Thaldraszus, may similarly become empowered. These types of herbs grant a boon to the herbalist who stumbles upon them, as well as some Rousing Order.\r\n\r\nHerbalists specialized in Titan-Touched herbs will gain the following effect when gathering:\r\n\r\n Enlightened Potential:\r\nSpeed increased by 15%. Gatherers specialized in Titan-Touched nodes will also have their secondary stats increased by 3%.",
