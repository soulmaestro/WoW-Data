    "description": "While Soaring through the air, pointing yourself toward any given direction sends you in that direction.\r\n\r\nPointing yourself downward grants more momentum. Evening out can transfer that momentum forward.\r\n\r\nPointing yourself upward slows you down. When at your slowest, you will start to fall slowly toward the ground, forward and down.\r\n\r\nYou also gain access to the following abilities:\r\n\r\n Surge Forward\r\nFlap forward a short distance, gaining speed.\r\nMax 2 Charges\r\n\r\n Skyward Ascent\r\nFlap upward, gaining height at the cost of some momentum.\r\nMax 1 Charge",
