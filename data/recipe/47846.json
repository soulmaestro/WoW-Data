    "description": "Bubble Poppy is a delicate herb that grows in the aquatic locales of the Dragon Isles. It grows along the rivers, coasts, and inside damp caves. \r\n\r\nDespite its unique appearance, the Bubble Poppy flower isn't particularly useful. Rather, the watery, fungal orb that forms at its base is where the real value lies.\r\n\r\nSome herbs grow particularly well and thrive for any number of reasons, regardless of climate or location. Herbalists who come across these rare nodes can retrieve additional usable materials.",
