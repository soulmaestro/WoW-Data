    "description": "Summons a totem at your feet for 15 sec that collects power from all of your healing spells. When the totem expires or dies, the stored power is released, healing all injured allies within 40 yards for 30% of all healing done while it was active, divided evenly among targets.\r\n\r\nCasting this spell a second time recalls the totem and releases the healing.",
