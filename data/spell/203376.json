    "description": "Emmarel Shadewarden was a young Sentinel when the Unseen Path was founded. Like her mentor, Namuria Gladesong, Emmarel believed that the night elves had a duty to protect Azeroth from the inevitable return of the Legion. After her order was all but wiped out in the War of the Shifting Sands, Emmarel kept the Unseen Path small and secluded, watching for the day when it should rise again.00During the long years of her vigil, Emmarel studied the ways of the beast master. She is never far from the wings of her beloved eagle companion, Snowfeather.",
