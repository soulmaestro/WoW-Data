    "description": "Koltira was raised into undeath as a Death Knight after being slain by the knight, Thassarian. Despite death at Thassarian's hand, they treated each other as friends up till they found themselves on opposing sides in the Battle for Andorhal. In this battle they held a truce that prevented outright hostilities until Sylvanas Windrunner became involved and he was cast into the Undercity by the Bainshee Queen. When asked about this Koltira refuses to speak any further.",
