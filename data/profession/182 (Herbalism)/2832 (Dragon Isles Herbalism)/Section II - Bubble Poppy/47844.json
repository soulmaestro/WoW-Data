    "description": "Bubble Poppy is a delicate herb that grows in the aquatic locales of the Dragon Isles. It grows along the rivers, coasts, and inside damp caves. \r\n\r\nDespite its unique appearance, the Bubble Poppy flower isn't particularly useful. Rather, the watery, fungal orb that forms at its base is where the real value lies.\r\n\r\nHerbs exposed to the essence of Decay become wilted versions of their former selves. The plants are still usable, but any would-be gatherers are exposed to the Decay, afflicting them with illness. It can be worth it though, as these herbs are a dependable source of Rousing Decay.\r\n\r\nHerbalists specialized in Decayed herbs will gain the following effect when gathering:\r\n\r\n Controlled Decay:\r\nBecome empowered by present Decay magic. Your Overload Elemental Herb spell is recharging at 400% the normal rate.",
